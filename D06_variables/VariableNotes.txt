===========================================

In the dynamic typed programming or loosly coupled language without using declearing the variable can accesss it.

In javascript there are three types of variable to store the data types(i.e. information).
i.e 1.var, 2.let, 3.const

By w3schools
------------
Variables are Containers for Storing Data.
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

var
---
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

let
---
Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const
-----
Declares a read-only named constant.

var

Hoisting
---------var declarations, wherever they occur in a script, are processed before any code within the script is executed. Declaring a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared. This behavior is called hoisting, as it appears that the variable declaration is moved to the top of the function, static initialization block, or script source in which it occurs.
